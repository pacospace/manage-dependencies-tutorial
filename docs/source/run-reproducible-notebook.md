# Run reproducible notebook

Let's say I have a reproducible notebook that someone shared with me.


## Other cases

You can consider another use case for managing dependencies:

- [start working on a new notebook](./start-new-notebook.md)

- [create dependencies for your existing notebook](./add-missing-dependencies-notebook.md)

- [convert notebook that uses pip commands in cells](./convert-notebook.md)


## Next steps

[Remove kernels](./clean-kernel.md)
